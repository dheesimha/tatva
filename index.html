        <h2>Here's why your kids will love Tatva ❤</h2>
        <p>
          As a school founded on the idea of the natural developments of
          children, Tatva arranges field trips, with an eye on blending
          theoretical knowledge with real-life experiences. Following a hands-on
          approach, using visual aids and special kits, we aim the all-round
          development of children. We employ methods such as storytelling,
          in-house decodable books (Sound crackers), Phonetics, Vibrant Puppets,
          Picture and letter cards. We intend to lay a strong foundation for
          basic subjects by employing innovative educational methods. To adopt
          children for a more advanced, technology-driven world, we have also
          incorporated Robotics as part of the curriculum,

        <h2>Our mission and vision</h2>
        <p>

          where children can follow the path of self- exploration and soar high
          to their horizons of dreams
